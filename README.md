Mini projects on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence concepts

Steps to run the code:
Download the code on your local machine.

prerequisite: You will require a code editor, say Jupyter notebook and for that, I would recommend using the Anaconda distribution to install Python and Jupyter.
Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.
Use the following installation steps:
